# Parameters for acct_gather_energy/impi plugin

# This parameter is the number of seconds between BMC access samples.
EnergyIPMIFrequency=30

# If set to "yes", the consumption between the last BMC access sample and a step
# consumption update is approximated to get more accurate task consumption. The
# adjustment is made at the step start and each time the consumption is updated,
# including the step end. The approximations are not accumulated, only the first
# and last adjustments are used to calculated the consumption. The default is "no".
EnergyIPMICalcAdjustment=no

# Optionally specify the ids of the sensors to used. Multiple <key=values>
# can be set with ";" separators. The key "Node" is mandatory and is used to
# know the consumed energy for nodes (scontrol show node) and jobs (sacct).
# Other keys are optional and are named by usernameistrator. These keys are useful
# only when profile is activated for energy to store power (in watt) of each key.
# <values> are integers, multiple values can be set with "," separators. The sum
# of the listed sensors is used for each key. EnergyIPMIPowerSensors is optional,
# default value is "Node=number" where "number" is the id of the first power
# sensor returned by ipmi-sensors.
# i.e.
# EnergyIPMIPowerSensors=Node=16,19,23,26;Socket0=16,23;Socket1=19,26;SSUP=23,26;KNC=16,19
# EnergyIPMIPowerSensors=Node=29,32;SSUP0=29;SSUP1=32
# EnergyIPMIPowerSensors=Node=1280

# EnergyIPMIPowerSensors=<key=values>

# Specify BMC Username.
EnergyIPMIUsername=password
